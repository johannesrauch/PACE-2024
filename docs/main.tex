\section{Preliminaries}\label{sec:pre}
An instance $(G = (A, B, E), \pi_A)$ of \OSCM{} is a bipartite graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, bipartition sets $A$ and $B$, and a linear ordering $\pi_A$ of $A$.
The goal is to find a linear ordering $\pi_B$ of $B$ that minimizes the number of crossing edges if the graph were to be drawn in the plane such that
\begin{itemize}
	\item the vertices of $A$ and $B$ are on two distinct parallel lines, respectively, and 
	\item the order of the vertices of $A$ and $B$ on the lines is consistent with $\pi_A$ and $\pi_B$, respectively.
\end{itemize}
We assume that $A = [n_0] := \{1, \dots, n_0\}$ and $B = \{n_0 + 1, \dots, n_0 + n_1\}$ for some positive integers $n_0$ and $n_1$.
We think of $\pi_A$ and $\pi_B$ as bijections $A \rightarrow [n_0]$ and $B \rightarrow [n_1]$, respectively.
If $\pi_B(u) < \pi_B(v)$ for $u, v \in B$, we say that $u$ is ordered before $v$, or $u$ is to the left of $v$.

Let $c_{u,v}$ denote the number of crossings of edges incident to $u, v \in B$ if $\pi_B(u) < \pi_B(v)$.
A mixed-integer program for \OSCM{} is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{mip}
\begin{alignedat}{2}
\text{minimize } &\sum_{\substack{u, v \in B\\u < v}} (c_{u,v} - c_{v,u}) \cdot x_{u,v} + \sum_{\substack{u, v \in B\\u < v}} c_{v,u}\\
\text{subject to } &\begin{aligned}[t]
0 \leq x_{u,v} + x_{v,w} - x_{u,w} \leq 1 &\quad\text{for all }u,v,w \in B, u < v < w,\\
x_{u,v} \in \{0,1\} &\quad\text{for all }u,v \in B, u < v.
\end{aligned}
\end{alignedat}\tag{$P_I$}
\end{equation}
So, $u$ is ordered before $v$ if and only if $x_{u,v} = 1$ for $u, v \in B, u < v$.

%, with smaller values of $\pi_A$ and $\pi_B$ meaning ``more left''.
%See the handbook , Chapter 13, for an introduction to the topic.
%Note that the total number of crossings depends only on the relative positions of all unordered pairs of vertices.

\section{Overview}
The solver \textsf{weberknecht(\_h)} is written in C++.
First, the exact solver \textsf{weberknecht} runs the uninformed and improvement heuristics described in Section~\ref{sec:heu}.
Then it applies the data reduction rules described in Section~\ref{sec:red}.
Last, it solves a reduced version of the mixed-integer program associated to the input instance with a custom branch and bound and cut algorithm described in Section~\ref{sec:bnb}.
The heuristic solver \textsf{weberknecht\_h} only runs the uninformed and improvement heuristic (except the local search heuristic).


\section{Heuristics}\label{sec:heu}
We distinguish between uninformed and informed heuristics, which build a solution from the ground up, and improvement heuristics, which try to improve a given solution.
Due to the reduction rules we may assume from here that there are no isolated vertices in $G$.

\medskip
\noindent
\textbf{Uninformed Heuristics.}
The uninformed heuristics order the vertices of $B$ such that the \emph{scores} $s(v)$ of vertices $v \in B$ is non-decreasing:
\begin{itemize}
\item In the \emph{barycenter heuristic}, we have $s(v) = \frac{1}{d_G(v)} = \sum_{u \in N_G(v)} u$ (recall that $A = [n_0]$). Eades and Wormald~\cite{eades1994edge} proved that this method has an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$ approximation factor, which is best possible up to a constant factor under certain assumptions.
\item Let $d = d_G(v)$ and let $\{w_0, \dots, w_{d-1}\}$ be the neighbors of $v$ in $G$ with $w_0 < \dots < w_{d-1}$.
In the \emph{median heuristic}, the score of $v$ is $s(v) = w_{(d-1)/2}$ if $d$ is odd and $s(v) = (w_{d/2 - 1} + w_{d/2})/2$ if $d$ is even.
Eades and Wormald~\cite{eades1994edge} proved that this method is a factor three approximation algorithm.
\item In the \emph{probabilistic median heuristic}, we draw a value $x$ from $[0.0957, 0.9043]$ uniformly at random, and the score of $v$ is then $s(v) = w_{\lfloor x \cdot d \rfloor}$.
This is essentially the approximation algorithm of Nagamochi~\cite{nagamochi2005improved}, which has an approximation factor of $1.4664$ in expectancy.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Informed Heuristics.}
The informed heuristics get a fractional solution of the linear program relaxation of \eqref{mip} as an additional input.
\begin{itemize}
\item The \emph{sort heuristic} works like a uninformed heuristics.
The score for vertex $v \in B$ is $s(v) = \sum_{u \in B, u < v} x_{u,v} + \sum_{u \in B, v < u} (1 - x_{v, u})$.
\item Classical \emph{randomized rounding heuristic}.
\item \emph{Relaxation induced neighborhood search}~\cite{danna2005exploring}.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Improvement Heuristics.}
Assume that $\pi_B = u_1u_2 \dots u_{n_1}$ is the current best solution.
\begin{itemize}
\item The \emph{shift heuristic} that GrÃ¶tschel et al.~\cite{grotschel1984cutting} describes tries if shifting a single vertex improves the current solution.
\item In the \emph{local search heuristic}, we solve a reduced version of \eqref{mip} to optimality, where we only add variables $x_{u_i, u_j}$ with $|i-j| < w$ for some parameter $w$.
\end{itemize}

\section{Data Reduction}\label{sec:red}
The solver \textsf{weberknecht} implements the following data reduction rules:
\begin{itemize}
\item Vertices of degree zero in $B$ are put on the leftmost positions in the linear ordering $\pi_B$.
\item Let $l_v$ ($r_v$) be the neighbor of $v \in B$ in $G$ that minimizes (maximizes) $\pi_A$, respectively.
Dujmovi\'c and Whitesides~\cite{dujmovic2004efficient} noted that, if there exists two nonempty sets $B_1, B_2 \subseteq B$ and a vertex $q \in A$ such that for all $v \in B_1$ we have that $\pi_A(r_v) \leq \pi_A(q)$, and for all $v \in B_2$ we have that $\pi_A(q) \leq \pi_A(l_v)$,
then the vertices of $B_1$ appear before the vertices $B_2$ in an optimal solution.
In this case we can split the instance into two subinstances.
%$$(G_i = (A_i = N_G(B_i), B_i, E[A_i \cup B_i]), \pi_A|_{A_i}) \quad \text{for $i=1,2$}.$$
\item Dujmovi\'c and Whitesides~\cite{dujmovic2004efficient} proved that, 
if $\pi_B$ is an optimal solution, and $c_{u, v} = 0$ and $c_{v, u} > 0$,
then $\pi_B(u) < \pi_B(v)$.
\item Dujmovi\'{c} et al.~\cite{dujmovic2008fixed} described a particular case of the next reduction rule.
Let $c_{u, v} < c_{v, u}$. 
We describe the idea with the example in Figure~\ref{fig:rr}.
Imagine that we draw some edge $x_iy_j$ into Figure~\ref{fig:rr}.
If the number of edges crossed by $x_iy_j$ on the left side is at most the number of edges crossed by $x_iy_j$ on the right side for all edges of the form $x_iy_j$, then we have $\pi_B(u) < \pi_B(v)$ in any optimal solution $\pi_B$:
Otherwise we could improve the solution by simply exchanging the positions of $u$ and $v$.
Note that this reduction rule is only applicable if $d_G(u) = d_G(v)$ as witnessed by $x_2y_1$ and $x_2y_k$ ($k=5$ here).
\item The value $\ell b = \sum_{u, v \in B, u < v} \min(c_{u,v}, c_{v,u})$ is a lower bound on the number of crossings of an optimal solution.
Suppose that we have already computed a solution with $ub$ crossings.
Then, if $c_{u,v} \geq ub - \ell b$ for some $u, v \in B$, it suffices to only consider orderings $\pi_B$ with $\pi_B(u) > \pi_B(v)$ for the remaining execution.
\item After the execution of the described reduction rules, some variables $x_{u,v}$ of $(P_I)$ have a fixed value due to the constraints.
\end{itemize}

\section{Branch and Bound and Cut}\label{sec:bnb}
The solver \textsf{weberknecht} implements a rudimentary branch and bound and cut algorithm.
We use HiGHS~\cite{huangfu2018parallelizing} only as a linear program solver since it does not (yet) implement lazy constraints.
To avoid adding all $\Theta(n^3)$ constraints, we solve the linear program relaxation of \eqref{mip} as follows.
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Create a linear program $(P)$ with the objective function of \eqref{mip} and no constraints.
\item Solve $(P)$.
\item If the current solution violates constraints of \eqref{mip}, add them to $(P)$ and go to 2.
\end{enumerate}

Let $ub$ denote the number of crossings of the current best solution.
Then, until we have a optimal solution, \textsf{weberknecht} does the following:
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Solve $(P)$ with the method described above.
\item If $(P)$ is infeasible, backtrack.
\item If the rounded objective value of $P$ is at least $ub$, backtrack.
\item If the current solution of $(P)$ is integral, update the best solution and backtrack.
\item Run informed heuristics and branch.
\end{enumerate}
